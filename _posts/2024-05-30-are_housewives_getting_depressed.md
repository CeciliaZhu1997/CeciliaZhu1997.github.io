This study aims to explore housewivesâ€™ digital expression based on 1800 videos from YouTube using a supervised machine learning approach.

The research question of this study is as follows:<br>
*RQ*: Do housewife-related videos on social media tend to express depression? 

The hypotheses are as follows:<br>
*H1*: Compared to videos related to working women, housewife-related videos on social media express a higher level of depression.<br>
*H2*: Compared to daily vlog videos, housewife-related videos on social media express a higher level of depression.

Supervised machine learning (SML) was used in this study to detect depression from the transcripts of the video database. Using the Bag of Words approach, multiple classifiers were trained with this labelled dataset after pre-processing. Finally, the Support Vector Machine with Tfidf Vectorizer was selected, achieving a performance accuracy of 0.93.

A one-way ANOVA test was conducted to answer the research question. The results indicate that the depression level of videos related to career women (*M* = 0.35, *SD* = 0.48) was significantly higher than videos related to housewives (*M* = 0.17, *SD* = 0.38) and daily vlogs (*M* = 0.07, *SD* = 0.25), *F* = 34.1596, *p* < 0.001.

Regarding the hypotheses, *H1* can be rejected, as housewife-related videos on social media express a lower level of depression compared to videos related to working women. *H2* can be retained, as housewife-related videos on social media express a higher level of depression than regular vlog videos.
