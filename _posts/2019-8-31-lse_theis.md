<h4>Abstract</h4>

There is a growing trend in China where Boys' Love novels are becoming increasingly popular among female readers. Boys' Love is a genre originating from Japan that depicts romantic stories between gay men. However, Boys' Love stories are continuously regulated by authorities. Issues of gender and homosexuality have been discussed for over ten decades, closely connected with power and hegemony.

The research question proposed in this study is: "In the Chinese context, to what extent do representations of male characters in Boys' Love fiction challenge gender hegemony?" To explore this research question, critical discourse analysis and interviews will be applied in the dissertation.

Based on data from Jinjiang Literary City, one of the most influential online literary websites in China, the three most popular Boys' Love fictions were selected as samples. A number of passages were extracted from these fictions to conduct a critical discourse analysis. In addition, ten female readers of Chinese Boys' Love novels were interviewed through online messaging applications, participating in semi-structured interviews lasting for an hour. They were asked questions centered on their reading motivations and preferences and also provided comments on the extracted materials for critical discourse analysis.

The critical discourse analysis was conducted on the selected samples from textual, discursive, and societal dimensions, alongside thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. The dissertation concludes that Boys' Love narratives in China can be regarded as a form of compromised resistance against gender hegemony in a patriarchal society.
