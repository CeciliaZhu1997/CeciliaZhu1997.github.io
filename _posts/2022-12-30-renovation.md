I led a very meaningful project during my three-year work experience at Xiaomi. The project involved using Xiaomi Smart AIoT products to renovate the homes of brand users **for free** who were in need.

My role in this project was as follows:

- **Establish Activity Mechanism**: Set up event landing pages and create a complete event process, including recruiting candidates, screening, contacting interior designers, and completing home renovations based on candidates' needs. Ensure the delivery of products and on-site renovations globally, including in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

- **Produce and Plan Promotional Content**: Film the renovation process and develop a dissemination plan. Execute the promotion across multiple social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok.

The event and relevant videos/posts achieved significant influence globally, reaching over 18 million impressions, 10 million views, and over 50 thousand registrants in total. Here are some of the videos produced under my supervision:
