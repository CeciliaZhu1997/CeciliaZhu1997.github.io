<h4>Abstract</h4>

In the era of Web 2.0, We-Media, represented by WeChat subscription accounts, plays an important role in shaping public opinion. In November 2017, the murder case of Jiang Ge, a Chinese female student studying in Japan, garnered long-term attention on Chinese social media platforms. We-Media, particularly WeChat subscription accounts, significantly attracted public attention, set public agendas, and disseminated information during the trial. This paper aims to discuss the innovation and development of We-Media writing skills, using the Jiang Ge murder case as a research example.

Firstly, the definition of We-Media is expanded beyond citizen reporters involved in news production to include individuals or organizations acting as media in a broader sense. From the perspective of bystanders and recipients, this paper highlights the critical role We-Media played in influencing public opinion. It also outlines the research objectives and methods used in this study. 

The paper uses the number of textual readings and textual similarity—measured by the number of fully reprinted WeChat subscription accounts—as two indicators of influence. Then, 119 of the most influential WeChat subscription account articles from November to December 2017 were selected to analyze the writing skills of We-Media.

In the writing of WeChat subscription accounts regarding the Jiang Ge murder case, more sophisticated writing techniques have emerged. Thematically, emotional orientation predominates over legal analysis. The spiral of silence is evident, with articles aligning with notions of naivety and justice being more widely disseminated. The titles of these articles emphasize skillful presentation over tone, offering rich and clear perspectives from individual viewpoints. Titles often employ inversion to create an element of surprise. In the main body of the articles, fragmented writing featuring personal emotions is prevalent.

Additionally, the extended duration of social media discussions provided a continuous supply of factual information. This paper also examines the WeChat subscription account "Wang Zhian" to analyze the writing techniques employed by We-Media in dynamic social contexts. These writings exhibit a comprehensive planning approach and present content in multimedia forms such as audio, text, and images. Popular issues are pursued in the writing techniques.

In conclusion, articles about the Jiang Ge murder case on WeChat subscription accounts reflect the general trends in We-Media writing. The most popular accounts demonstrate clear herd behavior in shaping opinion trends. Influenced by strong personal emotions, the dramatic trend in journalism, evident in We-Media articles about this murder case, is significant. Fragmentary information dissemination accelerates the spread of rumors.
