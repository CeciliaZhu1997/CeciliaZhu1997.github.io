This is a very special campaign as it is my first time working independently as a project manager, just six months into my first full-time job. We completed a global marketing event -- inviting our users from every time zone in the world to celebrate New Year together!

<h4>Introduction</h4>
The campaign, titled Xiaomi POP - 24 New Years, hosted a 24-hour livestream starting from New Zealand, where the time is the earliest (GMT+12) and has the very first New Year worldwide, and ended at Aitutaki, one of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific (GMT-10), the last time zone globally. From each time zone, we invited one individual or a group of brand users (actual users, not actors) to join the livestream and record their moments as the new year arrived. A total of 34 cities and 102 users from around the world participated, and the livestream ultimately garnered over 102 million impressions and 2 million clicks.<br>

<h4>My Responsibilities</h4>
Of course, this was a very challenging campaign for the project manager, but also inspiring, especially for someone who just started her career. I began preparing for this project in October 2020, and over the next two months, I completed the following tasks:

- **Creative Planning**: Developed activity ideas and planned event content, such as 24-hour live stream materials, promotional plans, and product promotion strategies during the event.
- **Activity Execution**: Coordinated project compliance applications to ensure global implementation; built the live stream webpage; created promotional content for various social platforms; set up offline event venues for live stream recording; produced and sent event-related gifts to participating users.
- **Project Management**: Led a team of 10, collaborating with Xiaomi's 14 regional market teams, legal department, development department, and 18 other teams to ensure the smooth execution of the event.

And the thing I am most proud of: finding 102 brand users who were willing to join us! 

<h4>Result</h4>
The campaign was a success and received many heartfelt comments from audiences worldwide.

This is one of the best projects hosted by Xiaomi so far and this is to show how Xiaomi loves its Mi fans... This is something to remember

I haven't used any Xiaomi products so far but I hope to use one soon, consider that one of my New Year's wishes. After this amazing event though, I very much feel like part of Mi Family.
More success!
