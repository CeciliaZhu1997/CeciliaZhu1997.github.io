This is a very special campaign as it is my first time working independently as a project manager, just six months into my first full-time job. We completed a global marketing event -- inviting our users from every time zone in the world to celebrate New Year together!

The campaign, titled Xiaomi POP - 24 New Years, hosts a 24-hour live streaming, starting from New Zealand， where the time is the earliest(GMT+12) and has the very first new year all over the world, and ended at Aitutaki, one of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific (GMT-10）,which is the last time zone wordwide. from each time zone, we invited one or a group of brand users (true users, no actors) and invite them to join in the livestreaming and record their moments when the new year comes. 34 cities and 102 users from every corner of the world joined in, and the livestreaming finally received over 102 million impressions and 2 million clicks.
