***This research is from the coursework on Content Analysis.***

A recent trend observed on a number of websites featuring Boys’ love (BL) content is the popularity of hermaphrodite erotic novels in pan-Chinese areas. Departure from the traditional BL narrative archetype, the uke role in hermaphrodite stories, while typically assuming a male social identity, tends to be depicted as possessing both male and female genitalia. As few studies focused on this phenomenon, where females are actively and extensively engaging in creating images of hermaphrodites as a means to fulfil their sexual fantasies, this study conducted a quantitive content analysis based on 131 BL and hermaphrodite erotic novels, to investigate the relationship between the uke characters in those novels and the readership.

Therefore, this study proposes the following research question:

***RQ***: To what extent does the level of femininity of uke characters relate to the readership in the context of hermaphrodite erotic novels compared to erotic boys' love novels?

Since the uke characters represent idealized images for female readers, those with a higher level of feminism should make it easier for female readers to identify with and project themselves onto the character (Bacon-Smith, 1992; Welker, 2004), potentially facilitating a deeper immersion in the story and alignment with real-life relationships. We propose the following hypotheses

***H1***: In the context of hermaphrodite erotic novels, there is a positive relationship between the level of femininity of uke characters and their readership.

***H2***: In the context of erotic boys' love novels, there is a positive relationship between the level of femininity of uke characters and their readership.

The introduction of hermaphrodites, or more specifically, female genitals to BL erotic novels, may further strengthen this self-projection. Therefore, we propose Hypothesis 3.

***H3***: The positive relationship between the femininity of uke characters and readership is stronger in the context of hermaphrodite erotic novels, compared to erotic boys' love novels.

This study used quantitative content analysis to investigate the connection between the level of feminine characteristics and the readership of boy's love (BL) erotic narratives, specifically those portraying uke characters as hermaphrodites on the influential Haitang Literature Website. As the hashtag "BL" is one of the most popular and commonly used to tag both BL and hermaphrodite novels on this website with over 14 thousand novels, a total of 2624 novels marked as "complete" under this hashtag were selected as our initial population. A systematic sampling was then used to select every 13th novel from this pool, resulting in a sample of 200
novels. The first chapter of each of the 200 novels was selected as our final coding material. 

The independent variable of this study is the femininity level of the uke character in each novel. The uke role, in this context, refers to the receptive role in sexual activities, and the first uke role introduced in the chapter was analyzed. Four dimensions were established based on Zhou et al.'s (2017) framework to measure the femininity level of the uke role: physical traits and appearance, emotional expression, autonomy and household roles, and sexual dynamics. Each dimension comprises several binary coding questions with "yes" or "no" options. Characters conforming to traditional femininity expectations are recoded as 1 score and those that do not conform are coded as 0 score. If a question lacks information, it is also coded as 0 (See Codebook for detailed coding instructions and explanations). Then the independent variable is calculated by summing up the average score of each dimension.

The dependent variable in this study is the readership of each novel, measured by the subscription number (unit: hundred), as the subscriptions on Haitang typically reflect readers' fondness for a novel and their willingness to follow updates or continue reading it. Therefore, the subscription number can serve as a reliable indicator of the novel's readership in this context. The moderator in this study is the type of erotic novels: BL and hermaphrodites, created as a dummy variable (BL - 0, hermaphrodite = 1).

For the pilot study, a codebook comprising 17 units was created on Qualtrics. Each of the four coders coded the same 36 novels selected from the SosadFun website following the same sampling strategy as the main study. The intercoder reliability tests resulted in relatively acceptable scores, with 12 variables scoring over 0.6.

Contrary to the hypothesized positive correlation, the findings indicated that the femininity levels of uke characters do not significantly correlate with readership in either category of erotic novels. The effect of the uke character’s femininity level does not show variation across different types of erotic novels either. Therefore, the level of femininity of uke characters does not correlate to the readership in the context of hermaphrodite erotic novels and erotic boys’ love novels.

The exploratory analysis reflects the expectations of authors regarding uke roles in hermaphrodite novels: they are expected to be more feminine and beautiful, less economically independent, and more sexually conservative, in other words, to conform more
to traditional femininity than uke roles in BL narrative.
