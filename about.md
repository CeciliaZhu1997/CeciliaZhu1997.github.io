I am Dongdong Zhu, a research master’s student in the Department of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. Before this, I completed my first master’s degree in Media and Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2019, and my bachelor’s degree at the School of Journalism, Renmin University of China, in 2018. My research interests include the diversity of online self-presentations of females, the impact of algorithms on social media users’ behavior, and the use of computational methods in the social sciences.
